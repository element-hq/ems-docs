# Configuring Group Sync

## What is Group Sync?

Group Sync allows you to use the ACLs from your identity infrastructure in order to set up permissions on Spaces and Rooms in the Element Ecosystem. Please note that the initial version we are providing
only supports a single node, non-federated configuration.

## On Element Enterprise

- In the installer root directory, Copy the sample file from
`config-sample/groupsync/gsync.yml` to `extra-config/groupsync`
- Edit the file with the following values. Note that Element
will provide you with the `ems_bridges_registry_token_name` and the
`ems_bridges_registry_token_password`.
  - `ems_bridges_registry_username`: ems_bridges_registry_token_name
  - `ems_bridges_registry_password`: ems_bridges_registry_token_password
  - `ldap_check_interval_seconds`: The interval check in seconds
  - `ldap_uri`: The LDAP Uri to connect to the ldap server
  - `ldap_base`: The LDAP base used to build the space hierarchy. This OU
  will become the root space. Every OU below this base will be a child-space.
  - `ldap_bind_dn`: The user bind dn to use to read the space hierarchy.
  - `ldap_bind_password`: The user password
  - `ldap_attrs_uid`: The attribute to use to map to users mxids
  - `ldap_attrs_name`: The attribute to use to map to spaces names
  - `group_power_levels` : A list of LDAP security groups that'll determine
  people's Matrix power levels. This affects only the OU (Space) that the
  Group belongs to â€“ doesn't leak up or down.
  - `provisioner.dn_default_prefix`: Display names starting with this prefix
  will get corrected according to the names we found for their users in
  LDAP. Optional. Useful if you're using an OIDC provider that doesn't give
  you users' display names.
  - `provisioner.default_rooms` : Optional. A list of rooms that'll get
  automatically created in in managed space. The ID is required to enable
  GPS to track whether they were already created or not. You can change it,
  but it'll cause new rooms to be generated.
  - `provisioner.whitelisted_users` : Optional. A list of userid patterns
  that will not get kicked from rooms even if they don't belong to them
  according to LDAP. This is useful for things like the auditbot. Patterns
  listed here will be wrapped in ^ and $ before matching.

- Restart the install script
